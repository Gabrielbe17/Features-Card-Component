## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

### Screenshot

![](/design/desktop-design.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### Useful resources

- [](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) - In this project I used for the first time pseudo-elements(::before and ::after). MDN is really helpful to learn web dev.
